# golfsim
A repository for my project simulating golf matches between some of the greatest golfers of all time.

The main file in this repository is golfsim.cpp, which enables users to run two different types of competitions between golfers: stroke play and match play tournaments. Both of these types of competition rely on www.thealltimegreatestgolfers.com to give an indication of the skill level of each historical golfer, which determines their likelihood for success in these competitions.

The first option for simulation, stroke play, simulates what would happen if the greatest male golfers ever played their careers at the same time. The program gives an indication of how many major tournaments each golfer would win in the amount of years that the user specifies. The second option, match play, simulates a user-specified number of match play tournaments between the greatest golfers ever. 

There are plenty of opportunities for improvement with this code, some of which are quick fixes and others of which may be long-term goals. A couple quick fixes I intend to work on are allowing the user to specify the text file they want to be imported, not having the number of golfers in each type of competition hard-coded in, some more error checking, and maybe some tweaking to fix inefficient bits of code. I'd also like to add a feature showing how many PGA Tour victories each player would rack up in the Career mode in addition to just showing how many majors they would win. Finally, my biggest long-term goal is to have players' names and rankings pulled directly from thealltimegreatestgolfers.com instead of a text file that was manually created. I have no idea how to do this yet, but it'd be great to figure out so that the text file wouldn't need to be constantly updated. Also, I think thealltimegreatestgolfers.com is great, but if a better source for historical ratings of golfers were available I'd be open to that instead. 

Feel free to tweak any aspect of this you'd like to see changed and create a pull request. I hope you find this at least somewhat interesting, even though I know it's not a definitive indication of what would happen in these scenarios in the slightest. Regardless, it's been a blast for me to make and I look forward to seeing what it can become and what it can help me learn!
